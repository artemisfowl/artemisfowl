# Hello there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artemisfowl/artemisfowl/master/assets/gifs/wave.gif" width="30px">

Welcome to my GHub profile. I am a simple engineer who likes to tinker with electronics as well as programming. For the people who know me professionally, I am a developer, but when I am not in
office, I prefer to program on various languages in different fields, whichever fancies my attention. That being said, I love programming in C and C++(primarily) and also dabble in Python. Currently
I am learning JS and React for fun. You can find me on [![Twitter][1.2]][1].
